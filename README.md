# HW 3: From Notebooks to Research Packages, Part 2

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/UCB-stat-159-f25/hw3-brianfdo/main?labpath=LOSC_Event_tutorial.ipynb)

_This repository is public so that Binder can find it. All code and data is based on the original [LIGO Center for Open Science Tutorial Repository](https://github.com/losc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial). This repository is a class exercise that restructures the original LIGO code for improved reproducibility, as a homework assignment for the [Fall 2025 installment of UC Berkeley's Stat 159/259 course, _Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science_](https://ucb-stat-159-f25.github.io/site/). Authorship of the original analysis code rests with the LIGO collaboration._

## Description

The LIGO project is an interesting experiment that proved the existence of gravitational waves by measuring small fluctuations of space. More information about the science and logic behind LIGO can be found in their tutorials found [here](https://github.com/losc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial).
